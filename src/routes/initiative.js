                                Not everyone enjoys the benefits we do. While some of us have the luxury to sit in our homes and not worry about expenses, there are many out there who have to work everyday outside in this pandemic to make ends meet. It is to help those families and individuals that we at Kuch Karo Foundation collect eatables, clothes, blankets, items of day to day activities and distribute them among those in need of them. Our efforts may not be enough but we hope that a day will come when no-one will have to struggle for basic necessities. Till then, our efforts wonâ€™t stop.

                            For empowerment and upliftment of underprivileged and marginalised women, KKF has started a new initiative. KKF helps and supports these women by helping them sell handicraft items like wallets, bags, handbags, purses, baskets, clothes, mobile support covers, etc. produced by them. These are great alternatives for polythene-based products, help in environmental conservation and a source of income. But most importantly it provides purpose to the lives of these women.
